	 Tired of making ED Sheets? Or did you just start making them? Solidworks is the workshop for you if you want the computer to sketch in 2-D for you and model and simulate the same sketch in 3-D.  No need to leave anything to imagination if you are 
     well acquainted with this software. Whether it is product designing or manufacturing tools design, SolidWorks makes your job easy. And we make it even easier by teaching you the A-Z of this 3-D CAD Design software.
