    <h1> Animation </h1><br />
    <p><i>
     It’s one thing to read a book, it’s entirely another when you watch a tutorial on the same topic. That’s the difference 
     between animate and inanimate objects. In simple language, animation just makes life a lot more interesting. With this 
     workshop in IEEE techweek, we will teach you how to make models in animation starting from scratch and then how that same model is to be animated; the sound effects to be added and how they are added. Not only do you learn how to make clippings 
     in 3-D animation, you also get to learn how to make simple videos using post production. Remember that last movie trailer that you thought was amazing, well, after this workshop you will get to try your hand at making something similar.
