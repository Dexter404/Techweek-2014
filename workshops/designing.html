    <h1> Graphic Designing </h1><br />
    <p><i>
     We’ve all blurred a facebook DP every now and then. Photoshop means the blur tool and a few more tools to the lay man. But 
     there’s more to Photoshop when it comes to designing. Posters, banners, fliers give an event a physical image whilst without 
     a pictorial representation; the event is just an imaginary idea. Even a website cannot be developed straightaway without 
     designing a user interface. The designing workshop explores every nook and cranny of Photoshop and at the end of this 
     workshop, you’ll be able to design masterpieces starting from simple grayscales.
