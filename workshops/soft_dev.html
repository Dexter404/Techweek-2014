    <h1> Software Development </h1><br />
    <p><i>
	 A software is more than a few lines of code. From collaborating between thousands of developers accross the globe, to making 
     it work on multiple devices and platforms, there is a lot more to software development than what meets the eye. This workshop
      aims to give a glimpse into the world of Mobile App Development, PC Software Development, and show how huge open source 
     projects like Linux, Android, Chrome and Firefox work, and how even you can contribute into such projects, or build your 
     software that eclipses them all.
